1. What if we dont return anything
in jS if u dont manually return something, 
 it automatically return undefined

 whenever we write the code global xution starts
 memory and code 
 every variable first initialized with undefined2nd phase execution startsinvoking of function execution context is created

 //callstack
 like a stack
 everytime global execution context put in stack
